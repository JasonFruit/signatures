# signatures

**Signatures** is a simple tool to make separate PDF files for each
bindable signature of a PDF book. It relies on pdfinfo and pdfbook,
the first of which is a standalone tool and the second of which is a
part of many LaTeX distributions.

It is especially good for converting a scanned PDF file of a public
domain book into a form more suitable for home binding.
